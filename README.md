# URL Shortener Service (Portfolio Demo)

*A practice project exploring Java & Kotlin interoperability with Spring Boot.*

## 📋 Overview

This project is a lightweight URL shortening service built to demonstrate backend development skills and explore the hybrid use of **Java** and **Kotlin** within a single **Spring Boot** application.

The primary goal of this project was to practice:
* Setting up a mixed-language build environment with **Maven**
* Implementing RESTful architecture
* Writing clean, maintainable code for a common real-world use case

It serves as a playground for testing concepts and filling out my GitHub portfolio with a working example of modern backend practices.
